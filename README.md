# Data-Visualization
• Plot histograms of count of players on the basis of some attributes like height.
• Distribution of players in different clubs/country on the basis of some attribute.
• Features of players according to their position.
• Can you use visualisation techniques to find outliers? Like Ronaldo and Messi.
